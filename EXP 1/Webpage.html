            <h1 style ="color: palegoldenrod;">Introduction</h1>
            <p style ="color: azure;">Novels are  fictitious prose narrative of book length, typically representing character and action with some degree of realism.  Its roots can be traced back thousands of years, though its origins in English are traditionally placed in the 18th century.
                The term novel is a truncation of the Italian word novella (from the plural of Latin novellus, a late variant of novus, meaning “new”), so that what is now, in most languages, a diminutive denotes historically the parent form. The novella was a kind of
                 enlarged anecdote like those to be found in the 14th-century Italian classic Boccaccio’s Decameron, each of which exemplifies the etymology well enough. </p>
                  <h1 style ="color: palegoldenrod;">Significance of novels in English Literature</h1><p style ="color: azure;">iterary novels are a broad category of books often regarded as having more intellectual merit than genre fiction. These novels are not as bound to formula, and authors feel greater
                     freedom to experiment with style; examine the psychology and motivations of their characters; and make commentary on larger social conditions or issues.Some of the famous novelsin English 
                    literature are Emma, Wuthering Heights, Moby-Dick, Middlemarch, The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn, Heart of Darkness, The Rainbow, Ulysses, Mrs Dalloway, and The Great Gatsby.</p>
            <h1 style ="color: palegoldenrod;">Genre</h1><p style ="color: azure;">Within its broad framework, the genre of the novel has encompassed an extensive range of types and styles: picaresque, epistolary, Gothic, romantic, realist, historical—to name only some of the more important ones.T
            he novel is a genre of fiction, and fiction may be defined as the art or craft of contriving, through the written word, representations of human life that instruct or divert or both. The various forms that fiction may take are best seen less as a number of separate categories
             than as a continuum or, more accurately, a cline, with some such brief form as the anecdote at one end of the scale and the longest conceivable novel at the other.
